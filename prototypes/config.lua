-- Whether to let the cargo locomotive accelerate slowly. This makes it less useful for short-distance 
-- transport or stop-and-go, but on the other hand, slowly accelerating locomotives are awesome!
CARGOLOC_SLOW_ACCELERATION = false

-- electro locomotive's max energy. This is limited by its max_power and should probably not be modified
MAX_ELOC_ENERGY = 20000

-- wether electro locomotives require nearby poles to function
ELOC_REQUIRE_POLES = true

-- max. distance to an eletric pole
ELOC_MAX_POLE_DISTANCE = 14
